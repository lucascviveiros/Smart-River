# Smart River

Smart River is a project still under development with a focus to show the respective values of the Fervença river in Portugal. We use an average analysis of three points under the river, the average by week and the months of the year, and showing the data in an animated way to the visitors of Centro Ciência Viva de Bragança. By joining technical skills with science communication, the project is being developed with Unity3D. We cover the Relative Air Humidity, Water Temperature, ambient temperature, conductivity, and pH.
