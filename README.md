# Smart River (Desktop)

Smart River Project is still under development, the focus of the project is to analyze and receive the data by the three sensors points under the river and show the respective attributes of the Fervença river in Portugal by generating 3D Graphs. We use an average analysis by week and by months of the year, and showing the data to the visitors of Centro Ciência Viva de Bragança in an animated way. By joining technical skills with science communication, the project is still being developed with Unity3D and Arduino. We cover the Relative Air Humidity, Water Temperature, Ambient Temperature, Conductivity, and pH of the river.
